Project Title: Seminar Prediction App for MAC Students at University of Windsor

Project Definition: 
The idea here is to get the seminars information from the MAC secretary + conduct a survey from MAC students about the seminars. Based on this data, some analysis must be performed. Later, an application must be developed which can predict topics/keywords the students might be interested in attending. Moreover, this project will involve getting information about any free seminars/courses which are available for MAC students in Windsor.  

The Seminar Prediction App for MAC Students is a specialized application designed to enhance the seminar experience for students in the Masters of Applied Computing (MAC) program at the University of Windsor. This app aims to predict and recommend seminars based on student interests, provide comprehensive seminar information, and offer a platform for feedback and resource sharing,
