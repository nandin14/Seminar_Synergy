The Graph Burning and The Firefighter Problems,Jilsa Chandarana,9:00 AM,"Friday, October 11th, 2024","Essex Hall, Room 122","With the increasing usage of social media, the spread of information has become abundant. However, this surge in accessible news and updates has also heightened the risk of spreading rumors. In our research, we explore two problems related to this phenomenon: the graph burning problem and the firefighter problem. We provide a comprehensive survey of the graph burning problem, a discrete-time process. Initially, all the vertices of the graph are unburned, and we start the fire at a single vertex. The fire then spreads to the adjacent vertices of the burned vertices, and at each step, we select a new vertex to burn. Our objective is to burn all the vertices in a minimum number of steps. The graph burning problem is NP-Complete. We review various approximation algorithms and bounds, highlighting significant advancements over the past decade. In the firefighter problem, a graph is given, and a fire starts from a subset of vertices. At each step, firefighters protect a certain number of vertices as the fire continues to spread to adjacent vertices."
